### About 

This webmap by default, loads a GeoJSON with a point for each of the 32 teams in the NFL. It also contains a table on the right hand side that is filtered to only show teams that are in the AFC (American Football Conference) one of the two conferences in the National Football League.

This GeoJSON was build using features made available by Leaflet.

### Filter

The three buttons that reside beneath the map allow the user to filter the GeoJSON. Upon clicking a button, the user is capable of filter for just AFC team, just NFC, or all of the teams, respectively.
